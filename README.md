A tool for logging work progress throughout the week. Features tags and pretty output.

## TODO:
 - hierarchical output for `print`
 - fix DB_CONNECTIONs all over the place
 - is there a bug with date.today() not working becuase it brings back local instead of utc?
 - autocomplete for tags https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/?highlight=complete
