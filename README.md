# jurn üìùü¶Ñ
A tool for logging work progress throughout the week. Features tags and pretty output. Log entries stored in a local sqlite database.

## Installation

`pip install jurn`

## Writing Entries

`jurn log -m 'Wrangled cats via lasso.'`

## Tagging

You can add tags to logs for hierarchical organization and display.

`jurn log -m 'Wrangled cats via lasso.' -t 'Physical Fitness'`

You can tab complete within the tag option. For example, if you typed in:

`jurn log -m 'Wrangled cats via lasso.' -t 'Physical <TAB>`

jurn would return the following bash-style autocomplete suggestions based on your history of previously used tags:

```
Physical Fitness
Physical Security
```

This helps ensure youre messages stay organized.

>  NOTE: To enable autocompletion, you must add this to your `~/.bashrc`. 
> ```
> eval "$(_JURN_COMPLETE=bash_source jurn)"
> ```
>If using other shells, please reference the [Click documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/shell-completion/?highlight=tab%20complete#enabling-completion) for the specific line you need to add.

You can also have subcategories by tagging with `#`, e.g. 

`jurn log -m 'Wrangled cats via lasso.' -t 'Physical Fitness#Cardio'`

## Printing (to the screen)

`jurn print -d week`

### Database

The jurn database is stored in the following location by default:

`~/.jurn/jurn.db`

You can override this with the `--db-path <folder path> --db-filename <filename>` options.

### Early End
The `--early-end` option bypasses `jurn` from executing if the specified amount of time has not passed since the last entry:

`jurn --early-end 60 log -t`

This option may be useful to supress `jurn` prompting too frequently if adding to a .bashrc file or schedule. For example, the above example command inserted into a .bashrc file will remind you to log your work with `jurn` *only* if at 60 minutes have passed since the last log entry.

### More Commands

Use `jurn --help` to view all available options.
