# jurn üìùü¶Ñ
A tool for logging work progress throughout the week. Features tags and pretty output. Log entries stored in a local sqlite database.

## Writing Entries

`jurn log -m 'Wrangled cats via lasso.'`

## Tagging

You can add tags to logs for hierarchical organization and display.

`jurn log -m 'Wrangled cats via lasso.' -t 'Physical Fitness'`

You can tab complete within the tag option. For example, if you typed in:

`jurn log -m 'Wrangled cats via lasso.' -t 'Physical <TAB>`

jurn would return the following bash-style autocomplete suggestions based on your history of previously used tags:

```
Physical Fitness
Physical Security
```

This helps ensure youre messages stay organized.

You can also have subcategories by tagging with `#`, e.g. 

`jurn log -m 'Wrangled cats via lasso.' -t 'Physical Fitness#Cardio'`
